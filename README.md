Fourier-Transformation is a jupyter Notebook that allows
` the vizualization` of the `Fourier Transformation`.

This project demonstrates how to work with numpy and jupyter Notebook to create:
  - an interactive jupyter Notebook showing the Fourier Transformation

If you have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact me.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed installed all requiered libaries (numpy, librosa, ipywidgets...)

## Installing Fourier-Transformation

To install Fourier-Transformation, follow these steps:

* Download this repository
* Unzip the downloaded file

## Using Fourier-Transformation

To use Fourier-Transformation, follow these steps:

* Start jupyter lab in the downloaded and unziped folder
```
C:\Fourier-Transformation>jupyter-lab
```
* Open the desired jupyter Notebook (english and german version)
* Execute the cells from the start to the end

## Possible Output

* Your jupyter-lab should start in your default browser and the files included in "Fourier-Transformation" should be shown
